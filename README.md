# Code Arena

This repo is a collection of scripts and code snippets written in different languages.

They are mainly for:

- Practicing and experimenting with ideas
- Revising concepts
- Building a deeper understanding of topics
- Reusing handy snippets when needed

Think of it as my coding playground - a place to learn, revisit, and grow.
